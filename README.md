# About
- Learning user website Authentication
- Passport strategy for authenticating with ***Facebook and Google using the OAuth 2.0 API.***
- This lets you authenticate using Facebook/Google in your Node.js applications. By plugging into Passport, Facebook/Google authentication can be easily and unobtrusively integrated into any application or framework that supports ***Connect-style middleware***, including Express.

## What I learntüìê
- PassportJs & Cookie sessions for Authentication
- Bcrypt,Hashing and salting
- Hashing using MD5
- Passport google oauth2
- Deploying node.js app to Heroku
- Setting up environment configurations
- MongoDb databse operations

## Version 1
- Each user can commit one secret under there user.id
- Secrets submitted stay annonymous
- User Interface will be updated in *** version 2.0.0.0 ***

## Configure Strategy
- The Facebook authentication strategy authenticates users using a Facebook account and OAuth 2.0 tokens.
- The app ID and secret obtained when creating an application are supplied as options when creating the strategy.
- The strategy also requires a verify callback, which receives the access token and optional refresh token, as well as profile which contains the authenticated user's Facebook profile. The verify callback must call cb providing a user to complete authentication.
